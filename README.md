# ReactBlog

   SPA blog app. The main reason for building it was to practice more with react+redux ecosystem.
   I learned a lot while working on this project. Backend is powered by expressjs. For now you can create and delete posts.
   There are also plans to implement the ability to edit posts as well as to add authentication.

## Demo

## Mobile support
The web app is responsive.

## Built with

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Redux](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) - a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) - promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js.
- [Semantic-UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) - framework that helps create responsive layouts using human-friendly HTML.
- and a ton of other cool frontend dev tools.
